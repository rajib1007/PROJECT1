# STUDENT ENQUIRY DATABASE ANALYSIS

This project will consist of using big data tools to answer questions about Student Enquiry Database. An student enquiry dataset combines all activities involved in the entire enrollment process and integrates them into a system. This way, everything happens in one place, both online and offline. The conversation happened with the prospects, their interests and motivations, their personal details, the meetings scheduled with them. There are a series of basic analysis questions. The questions should be answered using Hive.
Our aim is to help admission teams ultimately enroll more students.

# FEATURES
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

* Management team will be able to fetch number of students enrolled.

* They can fetch the list of students who done the demo or  missed the demo.

* This project has features like update, delete and append a new set of rows.

* Management team can perform bucketing and partitioning if required.

* We can also perform CRUD operation on our payment table because of its ORC nature.

* In this project all the tables overwritten from  master table. So we do not need to update each table individually.
